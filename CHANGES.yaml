    description: >-
      Add an `adopt(thennable)` method to settle an `ExtrinsicPromise` based on the settled state of another thennable.
    deprecated: >-
      This version was not published correctly. Although the `adopt` method was added to the source code, the code was not actually
      rebuilt correctly before beind published, so the published package does _not_ contain the new method. The new `adopt` method
      was first correctly published in release 3 (v1.2.0).
