          Ensure we're targeting node v6 for transpilation so it actually works in that version. This
          is probably a no-op because it should have already worked back to that version, based on CI testing.
          But this will ensure it does for good measure.

      'No longer supporting node v5, addressing bug #5 as wont fix'
      Note that there is no change to the actual interface, the only compatibility change is dropping support for node v5,
      which even there is only for build/development (i.e., you can still run this on node 5, you just cannot build)

    description: >-
      Add an `adopt(thennable)` method to settle an `ExtrinsicPromise` based on the settled state of another thennable.
    deprecated: >-
      This version was not published correctly. Although the `adopt` method was added to the source code, the code was not actually
      rebuilt correctly before beind published, so the published package does _not_ contain the new method. The new `adopt` method
      was first correctly published in release 3 (v1.2.0).
